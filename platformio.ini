; Setup Notes: 
;  Platformio currently has very poor support for cmsis. GitHub user frankleonrose 
;  created a fork of the atmelsam platform which works with cmsis, and I have updated 
;  that fork to the current master of atmelsam. Use that. If it claims linker scripts 
;  are missing, make sure it's using framework-cmsis-atmelsam from frankleonrose's repo 
;  instead of the platformio "official" version which is missing the linker scripts and 
;  startup files.
